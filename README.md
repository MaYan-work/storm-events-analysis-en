Storm Event Database - Group 2 ETC5513

In this project we use R as a programming language to conduct analysis data on storm events that occur in the United States from 2017 to 2019.
From the analysis it is known that:

- The most active months of thunderstorm wind were from May to August. Furthermore, the locations of theses events happened from middle and east of America slowly transformed to the east from July to October.

- Over all the years, there are less direct injuries of storm events from September to December, while more direct injuries happened on January June and July. Most direct deaths happened on January, June to September and November.

- In 2017, Georgia had the most direct injuries and Texas had the most direct deaths among all the states. In 2018, California had the most direct injuries and Arizona had the most direct deaths among all the states. In 2019, no state had more than 50 direct deaths, and Texas is slightly higher than others while Ohio had the most direct injuries. 

- Tornado caused most injuries in 2017 and 2019, while heat caused more injuries than other types of events in 2018. Excessive Heat caused most direct deaths among the five major event types in 2018, while flash flood caused slightly more direct deaths in 2017 and 2019. In addition, direct deaths caused by wildfire is decreasing in this time period.

- Seeing from top five most frequent events, most events have a similar trend. However,  hail has decreased in 2018 to 2019 years with floods increasing instead.

- Tornado mostly happen in May while Texas is the state with the highest number of tornado in USA.
